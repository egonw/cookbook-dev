```{admonition} Important
:class: tip
This section is highly standardized and is relied upon by another component developed by FAIRplus to enhance search and presentation. It is therefore important to comply with the layout. 
The authors should therefore edit the all but the `recipe metadata`. 
For the `Intended Audience` section, the allowed values should be picked from the following list:

    - Funder
    - Procurement Officer
    - Principal Investigator
    - Data Curator
    - Data Manager
    - Data Scientist
        - Chemoinformatician
        - Bioinformatician
    - Software Engineer
    - System Administrator
    - Terminology Manager
    - Ontologist


For the `Recipe Type` section, the allowed values should be picked from the following list:

    - Background information (introductory material)
    - Survey / Review (state of the art material)
    - Guidance (documentation aimed at both technical and non-technical audience)
    - Technical Guidance (documentation aimed at a technical audience, without executable code examples)
    - Hands-on (documentation aimed at a technical audience, with executable code examples available as jupyter notebooks)

## Capability & Maturity Table

This section is meant for authors to describe the specific `capability` which they aim to bring from one `maturity level` to the next.
This is therefore to document the methods used **to enable change** at the level of information process
The table is therefore structure to identify the capability, the **initial** maturity level it is estimated to be and the **final** maturity it has been brought to.


| Capability  | Initial Maturity Level | Final Maturity Level  |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Interoperability | minimal | repeatable |

## FAIRification Objectives, Inputs and Outputs

| Actions.Objectives.Tasks  | Input | Output  |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [validation](http://edamontology.org/operation_2428)  | [Structure Data File (SDF)](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.ew26v7)  | [report](http://edamontology.org/data_2048)  |

## Table of Data Standards

Authors should list all the data standards, format specification, syntax and controlled terminologies used in the FAIRification process applied to the IMI project data.
Ideally, authors should mark up the information using either EDAM Ontology URI or FAIRsharing identifiers (which are DOIs)

| Data Formats  | Terminologies | Models  |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| [FASTQ](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.r2ts5t)  | [LOINC](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.2mk2zb)  | [SRA XML](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.q72e3w)  |
| [DICOM](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.b7z8by)  | [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.kbtt7f)  | [OMOP](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.qk984b)  |

## Main Content

This is the place for your actual content. You can also ...

### ... write executable code


```python
import isatools
import json
import pandas as pd 
import holoview
```


### ... create workflow figures

If you want to include figures, please use the following 


<!-- 
```{figure} ./my_figure.svg
---
width: 700px
name: the figure title
alt: something to display if the link to the figure is broken
---
the proper caption for the figure.
```
-->

one may use the following **[mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)** syntax:

````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

```
graph LR;
    A[Data Acquisition] -->B(Raw Data)
    B --> C{FAIR by Design}
    C -->|Yes| D[Standard Compliant Data]
    C -->|No| E[Vendor locked Data]
```
````
which is then rendered like this:

````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR;
    A[Data Acquisition] -->B(Raw Data)
    B --> C{FAIR by Design}
    C -->|Yes| D[Standard Compliant Data]
    C -->|No| E[Vendor locked Data]
</div>
````

Authors of graphical representations using the mermaid syntax can also style their graphs, as shown below

````{panels} 
:container: container-lg pb-3
:column: col-lg-12 p-2
:card: rounded

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A[input data]-->B[conversion to open format]
    A[input data]-->C[automatic annotation]
    B[conversion to open format]-->D((output data))
    C[automatic annotation]-->D((output data))  
    style A fill:#FF5733,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#0A749B,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
</div>
````
