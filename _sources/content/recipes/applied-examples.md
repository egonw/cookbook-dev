# Applied Examples


This Chapter is dedicated to a complete FAIRification example, as applied by FAIR+ developers to public dataset. The content of the chapter documents all critical steps and learnings resulting from these efforts.

We will therefore cover topics such as:

## From PDF to RDF ~ From text to Linked Data Graph

1. [FAIRification of Metabolomics Data: Clarifying the Semantics of Data Matrices]()
2. [Conversion to an open format - using Frictionless Data Package]()
3. [Building a semantic model and annotating with open ontologies]()
4. [Conversion to RDF/Linked data and exploration with SPARQL]()


## IMI case studies

1. IMI eTOX - the safety context {ref}`fcb-fairify-examples-etox`
3. IMI ND4BB - the target identification context {ref}`fcb-fairify-examples-nd4bb`
4. IMI Resolute - the target identification context {ref}`fcb-fairify-examples-resolute`
2. IMI Oncotrack -  the clinical context {ref}`fcb-fairify-examples-oncotrack`
