## Main Objectives

The FAIR cookbook aims to provide hands-on, practical advice on how to deliver FAIR data through interactions with
Innovative Medicine Initiative projects. These research projects, by nature often involve patient-centric information
but dealing with real-world data and human-centric information, clinical data, in particular, is challenging. 
It most often mandates interacting with DACs, i.e. Data Access Committees, and undergoing a vetting process, 
which can be lengthy and convoluted. This can become a hindrance if the focus of the work is to deliver training on 
the computational methods available to deal with such data rather than data custody-related tasks,
however important these are. 

This FAIR cookbook recipe aims to provide a list of relevant resources belonging to the realm of clinical data so 
readers can, with the minimal hassle :
- familiarize with the data types (for instance, how do Electronic Health records look like).
- familiarize with the procedures to gain access to sensitive data.
- obtain datasets with which to work and hone computational skills.

The recipe will cover two types of datasets:
- `real datasets` such as the MIMIC-III dataset {footcite}`pmid27219127`, which corresponds to actual medical notes data
for which data access requests must be made but which are made available to computational scientists
for research purposes.
- `synthetic datasets`, which are available without restrictions since produced by computational methods 
and independent of any real patient. While handy, this type of data may come with a number of limitations prospective 
users need to be aware of.




### Electronic Health Records: The MIMIC-III Critical Care Database

````{dropdown}
:open:
- **Data Type**: Electronic Medical Notes
- **Nature of the data**: Real Patient Data
- **Availability**: 
    ****Requesting Access****:  
        https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/

    * https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/
    * From Amazon Web Service Public Data: https://registry.opendata.aws/mimiciii/
- **Description**: MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database 
comprising de-identified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care
units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. {footcite}`pmid27219127`. 
The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside 
(circa 1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports,
and mortality (both in and out of hospital).
- **Purpose**: MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement,
and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors: it is freely available to researchers worldwide. 
It encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients. it contains high temporal resolution data including
lab results, electronic documentation, and bedside monitor trends and waveforms.
- **Format**: SQL database dump

### Synthean Electronic Health Records

One of the main bottlenecks for data miners is the lack of dataset availability of electronic health records, due to,
as we saw it to HIPAA concerns. To bypass these roadblocks, several tools have been developed to generate synthetic datasets,
free of any restrictions. Below, we provide information about one such tool.
