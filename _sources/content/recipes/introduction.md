# Introduction

This chapter introduces the FAIR principles and why they matter to the Innovative Medicine Initiative.

The chapter also places this FAIR cookbook in a broader context of Data Science and how the organization of the book builds on trailblazing work by the Alan Turing's Institute.

Finally, the chapter delineates the data context the contributors decided to focus on, aware that the IMI EDHEN project, FAIRplus sister project, covers the space of data management for observsational studies.
