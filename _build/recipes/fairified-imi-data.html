<p>:oil_drum::construction: <strong>This project is still in early phase and this is work in progress</strong> :construction::oil_drum:</p>
<p>This Chapter is dedicated to the partial or complete FAIRification processes, as applied by FAIR+ developers to IMI generated datasets and will document critical steps and learnings resulting from these efforts.</p>
<p>We will therefore cover topics such as:</p>
<p>:warning: tentative outline</p>
<ol>
<li>FAIRification of Transcriptomics Data: the IMI RESOLUTE use case</li>
<li>FAIRification of Toxicology and Chemical exposure Data: the IMI eTOX use case</li>
<li>FAIRification of Translational Data: the IMI Oncotrack use case</li>
<li>FAIRification of Target Identification Data: the IMI ND4BB use case</li>
<li>FAIRification of Stem Cell Data: the IMI2 IBISC use case
....</li>
</ol>
