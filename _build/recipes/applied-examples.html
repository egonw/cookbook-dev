<p>This Chapter is dedicated to a complete FAIRification example, as applied by FAIR+ developers to public dataset. The content of the chapter documents all critical steps and learnings resulting from these efforts.</p>
<p>We will therefore cover topics such as:</p>
<p>:warning: tentative outline</p>
<ol>
<li>FAIRification of Metabolomics Data: Clarifying the Semantics of Data Matrices</li>
<li>Zenodo deposition</li>
<li>Conversion to an open format - using Frictionless Data Package</li>
<li>Building a semantic model and annotating with open ontologies</li>
<li>Conversion to RDF/Linked data and exploration with SPARQL</li>
</ol>
